This thesis tries to solve the problem that can be defined as how to access the data of a large number of PLCs, which can use different protocols and handle this massive data in real time in an easy way, being able to visualize and store it.

This project consists of the development of a big data pipeline that allows the extraction,
transformation and loading of the data generated by a large number of PLCs at the same time
in a database and the ability to visualize the data in real time.

The development of this project demonstrates how the pipelines developed with big data
technologies such as Apache ZooKeeper, Apache Kafka and Apache Spark, in combination
with the set of libraries that Apache PLC4X provides, are a very powerful tool to treat and
manage the data of a large number of PLCs in real time.

In this project 4 applications have been developed (2 (Java) PLC4X applications and 2 Spark applications) to implement the pipeline explained in the Master Thesis titled: "Big Data Pipeline for an ETL Process and Real Time Visualization of Data Generated by PLCs in an Industrial Environment".

The two java applications responsible for data extraction using PLC4X are called s7_readings and modbus_readings. The two Spark applications responsible for generating alarms and sending all the Kafka data to MySQL are called alarmGenerator and sparkTransformer.
