In this project 4 applications have been developed (2 PLC4X applications and 2 Spark applications) to implement the pipeline explained in the Master Thesis titled: "Big Data Pipeline for an ETL Process and Real Time Visualization of Data Generated by PLCs in an Industrial Environment".

The two java applications responsible for data extraction using PLC4X are called s7_readings and modbus_readings. The two Spark applications responsible for generating alarms and sending all the Kafka data to MySQL are called alarmGenerator and sparkTransformer.
